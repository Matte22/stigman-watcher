      <check>
        <check-content>Verify the version of the operating system is vendor supported.

Note: The lifecycle time spans and dates are subject to adjustment.

Check the version of the operating system with the following command:

$ sudo cat /etc/redhat-release

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 8.6 (Ootpa)

Current End of Extended Update Support for RHEL 8.2 is 30 April 2022.

Current End of Extended Update Support for RHEL 8.4 is 31 May 2023.

Current End of Maintenance Support for RHEL 8.5 is 31 May 2022.

Current End of Extended Update Support for RHEL 8.6 is 31 May 2024.

Current End of Maintenance Support for RHEL 8.7 is 31 May 2023.

Current End of Extended Update Support for RHEL 8.8 is 31 May 2025.

Current End of Maintenance Support for RHEL 8.9 is 31 May 2024.

Current End of Maintenance Support for RHEL 8.10 is 31 May 2029.

      <title>RHEL 8 vendor packaged system security patches and updates must be installed and up to date.</title>
      <check>
        <check-content>Verify the operating system security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by the site or Program Management Office (PMO).

Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for updates is https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/. It is important to note that updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed.

Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:

$ sudo yum history list | more

Loaded plugins: langpacks, product-id, subscription-manager
ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70 | install aide | 2020-03-05 10:58 | Install | 1 
69 | update -y | 2020-03-04 14:34 | Update | 18 EE
68 | install vlc | 2020-02-21 17:12 | Install | 21 
67 | update -y | 2020-02-21 17:04 | Update | 7 EE

If package updates have not been performed on the system within the timeframe the site/program documentation requires, this is a finding.

Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM.

If the operating system is in non-compliance with the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process, this is a finding.</check-content>

If FIPS mode is &quot;enabled&quot;, check to see if the kernel boot parameter is configured for FIPS mode with the following command:

If the kernel boot parameter is configured to use FIPS mode, check to see if the system is in FIPS mode with the following command:

     $ sudo cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled
     1

If FIPS mode is not &quot;on&quot;, the kernel boot parameter is not configured for FIPS mode, or the system does not have a value of &quot;1&quot; for &quot;fips_enabled&quot; in &quot;/proc/sys/crypto&quot;, this is a finding.</check-content>

        <check-content>Verify RHEL 8 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information requiring at-rest protection by using disk encryption. 

If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest encryption at the operating system level, such as encryption provided by a hypervisor or a disk storage array in a virtualized environment, this requirement is not applicable.

Verify all system partitions are encrypted with the following command:

     $ sudo blkid

     /dev/mapper/rhel-root:  UUID=&quot;67b7d7fe-de60-6fd0-befb-e6748cf97743&quot; TYPE=&quot;crypto_LUKS&quot;

Every persistent disk partition present must be of type &quot;crypto_LUKS&quot;. If any partitions other than the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) are not type &quot;crypto_LUKS&quot;, ask the administrator to indicate how the partitions are encrypted. 

If there is no evidence that these partitions are encrypted, this is a finding.</check-content>

Check for the location of the banner file being used with the following command:

$ sudo grep -ir banner /etc/ssh/sshd_config*

banner /etc/issue

This command will return the banner keyword and the name of the file that contains the ssh banner (in this case &quot;/etc/issue&quot;).

If the line is commented out, this is a finding.
If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

View the file specified by the banner keyword to check that it matches the text of the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.&quot;

If the system does not display a graphical logon banner or the banner does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.
